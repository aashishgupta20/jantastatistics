Thank you for visiting my blog! 

I have a PhD in Demography and Sociology from the University of Pennsylvania. Starting September 2021, I will be a David E. Bell Fellow at the Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies. I have been associated with the [research institute of compassionate economics](https://riceinstitute.org/), where I am a research fellow. I also volunteer with other social initiatives. My more academic website is [here](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/aashishg/). 

My work has received support from the the Civil Registration and Vital Statistics Fellowship of the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population and the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellowship (at Oxford University) of the European Commission. 

I was awarded the Dorothy Thomas Award by the Population Association of America in 2021.

This blog is more or less in the genre of brief notes meant for a small set of people who are interested in these things. In Hindi, demography is जन-सांख्यिकी, or people statistics. The subtitle, "reducing people to numbers. and words." is not meant to be taken seriously. The other subtitle I considered was "demography in the world's largest democracy". But I am not sure about the extent to which this blog would be about demography. We will see. In fact, I am not sure if I will write about all aspects of demography. My research focuses largely on health and mortality. I am not really an expert on migration or fertility. 

Over the years, I have learnt a lot from comments and feedback. Please do feel free to write to me if you have any comments, disagreements, or suggestions. Thank you!
