Thank you for visiting my blog!

I have a PhD in Demography and Sociology from the University of Pennsylvania. Starting September 2021, I will be a David E. Bell Fellow at the Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies.

My work has received support from the the Civil Registration and Vital Statistics Fellowship of the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population and the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellowship (at Oxford University) of the European Commission. 

I was awarded the Dorothy Thomas Award by the Population Association of America in 2021.
